## My process
I started off with the basic structure of the page by making a container and child div. The child div contains the advice and button. Once I had the layout done using CSS, I started the javascript and used ASYNC AWAIT to make a fetch to the API.
### Built with
- Flexbox
- Media Query
- Async Await
- Promises
- Javascript


### What I learned
Doing this project I got more comfortable using Async Await and working with API's. This project helped me polish up my developing skills.
